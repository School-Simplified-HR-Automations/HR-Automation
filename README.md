## Contributing

Before you want to change anything or want to make a new feature *always pull first*. Then, make a *new* branch for the feature you are making.

# Contibuting rules
1. Always pull first
2. Only use the default VSCode formatter "TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features".
3. Make a new branch for each feature you make.
4. Split things up into smaller commits
> Example:
> If I wanted to add a eval and execute command which would require a security service I should first push the security service, then eval, and then execute.
5. Before moving files around or changing essential files coordinate with others. 
> Example:
> If I wanted to move logger to services I should first open a issue.
6. Always request code reviews.
7. (Recommended) Link PRs to issues.
